# draw_square.py

# This script will draw a dark gray square in Inkscape.
# It is a placeholder for the actual implementation as I cannot directly interact with Inkscape.
# The instructions are to be executed manually in Inkscape.

# 1. Open Inkscape.
# 2. Use the Rectangle tool to draw a square in the center of the document.
# 3. Ensure the square has equal sides by holding `Ctrl` while dragging or by manually setting the width and height to be the same in the tool controls.
# 4. Set the fill color of the square to a dark gray (#333333 or similar - exact shade to be determined visually).
# 5. Remove any stroke/border from the square.
