# draw_square.py

# This script provides instructions for drawing a square with a radial gradient in Inkscape.
# The instructions are to be executed manually in Inkscape.

# 1. Open Inkscape.
# 2. Use the Rectangle tool to draw a square in the center of the document.
# 3. Ensure the square has equal sides by holding `Ctrl` while dragging or by manually setting the width and height to be the same in the tool controls.
# 4. Open the Fill and Stroke dialog (Shift+Ctrl+F).
# 5. In the 'Fill' tab, choose the Radial gradient option.
# 6. Edit the gradient to have two stops:
#    * Center stop: A slightly lighter gray (e.g., #555555).
#    * Outer stop: The dark gray color chosen for the square (e.g., #333333).
# 7. Adjust the gradient handles in the document to ensure the gradient is subtle and visually appealing. The goal is to add depth, not a strong color change.
# 8. Remove any stroke/border from the square.
