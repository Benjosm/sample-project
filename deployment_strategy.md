# Deployment Strategy

## Chosen Platform: Netlify

Netlify was chosen due to its ease of use, excellent free tier, and seamless integration with Git repositories.

## Deployment Steps:

1.  **Prepare your Project:** Ensure your website files (index.html, script.js, style.css, and any other assets) are in a project folder, ideally under Git version control.
2.  **Sign up for Netlify:** Create a free account on the Netlify website (https://www.netlify.com/).
3.  **Connect to Git Repository:**
    *   In your Netlify dashboard, choose "Add new site" and then "Import an existing project."
    *   Select your Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
    *   Authorize Netlify to access your repository.
    *   Choose the repository containing your website project.
    *   Configure build settings:
        *   **Build command:** (Leave blank for a static site, or specify if you are using a build process)
        *   **Publish directory:** The root directory of your project.
    *   Click "Deploy site."
4.  **Access your Site:** Netlify will provide a unique URL for your deployed website.  You can also set up a custom domain in Netlify's domain settings.
5.  **Custom Domain (Optional):**  If you have a domain, you can configure it in Netlify's domain settings. Netlify will provide instructions on how to update your DNS records.

## Considerations

*   **Assets:** Ensure all necessary assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) are correctly referenced in your HTML and included in the repository.
*   **Testing:** Test the deployed website thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
*   **Updates:**  After the initial deployment, subsequent updates can be deployed by pushing changes to your Git repository (Netlify will automatically deploy based on your settings).
