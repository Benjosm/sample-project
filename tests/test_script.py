# Assuming script.js exists and has some basic functionality
# You might need a way to run the javascript code, e.g., using a headless browser
# or a javascript runtime environment like Node.js

# For this example, we'll assume a simple function defined in script.js
# that can be accessed.

# It is important to note that testing javascript code will typically require
# more complex tools such as a javascript runtime or a browser.
# This test is only a simple example, and not a complete test

# This test case assumes the script.js file exists and is accessible
# and that we can call a testable function defined in script.js
# and also assumes this test can run without a browser.


# Example function that could be in script.js (for testing)
# function add(a, b) { return a + b; }


# It is difficult to test without a javascript runtime
# So this test will be skipped. If you want to test, you should
# write a test that can run javascript using a runtime or a browser.
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Requires a javascript runtime to execute the code.")

    # Replace this with your actual test logic
    # For example, if script.js defines a function called 'add'
    # and the function is available within the current python testing env
    # expected_result = 5
    # assert add(2, 3) == expected_result
    assert True # placeholder for now
