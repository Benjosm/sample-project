def test_animation_class_change(element_id, expected_class):
    # This test is designed to fail because the animation functionality is not implemented yet.
    # The animation is expected to add a class to the element when it runs.

    # In a real test, you would:
    # 1. Locate the element in the HTML (e.g., using Selenium or a similar tool).
    # 2. Trigger the animation (e.g., by calling a JavaScript function).
    # 3. Wait for the animation to complete or for a specific state.
    # 4. Assert that the element has the expected class.

    # For now, we assert a failure condition
    assert False, "Animation not implemented" #This will fail
